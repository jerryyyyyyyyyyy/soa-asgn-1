Both front-end and back-end are built in the same language, JS.

GLOBALS - No window
__dirname = path to the current directory.
__filename = file name
require = funtion to use modules (CommonJs)
module = information about current modele (file)
process = information about enviromnent where the program is being executed.

>>>>>Modules<<<<<
Parts or files of an app, since spliting up the code into short
ease up the life. otherwise, the whole code in a signle file can
create trouble.
Helps in complexities as in complex applications, modules become
self explanatory, why they`re important. And accessible from different files.
Helps on providing more structure to the application and smaller files.
Every file is a module by default.
for exporting a module from one file to another:
>>module.exports = { } "objects inside the braces".
>>module.exports = functionName "for a fucntion to be exported".
>>Importing a module also invokes it and a code doesnt get imported on its own.
>>* node wraps it in the function.

>>>>>Built-in Modules<<<<<
>os
>path
>fs
>http

We dont have to specify the path from the files for built-in modules.
as we did in earlier like: require('./6-alternate) etc. 
here we`re good to go with:

>>>  const os = require('os') 
>>>  const user = os.userInfo()
>>>  console.log(user)
>>>  {
  uid: -1,
  gid: -1,
  username: 'Asad LIAQAT',
  homedir: 'C:\\Users\\Asad LIAQAT',
  shell: null
}

>>File System, fs-module
has to types:
..synchronous - blocking
..asynchronous - nonblocking
